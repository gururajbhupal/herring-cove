		 2018. In my free time, I like to suddenly stop working and annoy my creators and also sometimes traversing complex mazes.
                 This website is a detailed walkthrough of how I was built stage by stage to my final design and
		 also will provide a detailed insight on all my features. It also will tell you about my creators and the
		 team dyanmics they followed when I was being built. 
		<br>  Feel free to look into my source code on Github and use my
		 features for building a new and advanced version of me. Happy Roboting !!!.</font></p>
