Team Procedures \
	1.	Team Meetings: We will meet on Monday at 7:30pm for the week on 9/3 and Sunday at 10am for \uc0\u8232 the rest of the semester in Duffield or Phillips. \u8232 \
	2.	Preferred Method of Communication: We will use GroupMe to communicate with each other and \uc0\u8232 a shared google folder to share documents when when we are not using github. \u8232 \
	3.	Decision-Making Policy: When decisions need to be made by everyone on the team, we will go with the general consensus. In the event our team is split two against two, the team lead for that \uc0\u8232 section of the semester will make the decision. \u8232 \
	4.	Method for setting and following meetings agendas: The team lead will be in charge of setting \uc0\u8232 and following meeting agendas and uploading it to the shared google folder. The agenda should be set at least a couple hours before the meeting. Other team members are encouraged to add what they think is important to the meeting agendas and to make sure we follow the agenda. \u8232 \
	5.	Method of record keeping: The team lead will take the necessary notes on the google doc already containing the agenda during the team meetings. \uc0\u8232 \
Team Expectations \
	1.	Work Quality\uc0\u8232 a. Project Standards: We will hold ourselves to a very high standard so in the case that we \u8232 do not meet the standard, we will still have a more than acceptable final product.\u8232 b. Strategies to fulfill standards: Since we are asking a lot of ourselves, our work will be \u8232 challenging. When we need help we will ask for it. When having any issues, we will first ask each other for help, then the TAs and then the professor. Individually, we will be using online resources for help. We will not hesitate to ask for help. \u8232 \
	2.	Team Participation\uc0\u8232 a. Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks: The team lead will \u8232 equally distribute tasks for each set of tasks. As members, we will communicate what are strengths are related to the tasks and give our input for what is a reasonable amount of work to give to a single person. \u8232 b. Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members: We will not hesitate to share our ideas and make sure everyone in the group has an opportunity to share their ideas. That being said, no one will be micromanaging anyone else to see that their ideas \u8232 \
are being used. We will decide as a group whose ideas will be used and when the tasks \
are assigned, the tasks will be completed with the group\'92s decided upon idea.\uc0\u8232 c. Strategies for keeping on task: Within reason, do not hesitate to say \'93Can we stay \
focused.\'94 We are all busy and our time is valuable we should not be wasting each other\'92s time. Being considerate is important as to not waste someone else\'92s time. This includes not being prepared for a meeting and wasting everyone\'92s time at the meeting, etc. \
d. Preferences for leadership: Leadership in this group means that you temporarily have more responsibilities and small decision making authority. Leadership does not mean complete control of the group. The leader should be informal. The leader will be respectful and listen to everyone to make decisions, which should usually be in agreement with all group members anyways, when making any decisions for the group. \
	3.	Personal Accountability \
	a.	Expected individual attendance, punctuality and participation at all team meeting: Buy a \uc0\u8232 watch and be on time. If you have a valid excuse that is acceptable. Not many of the weekly meetings should be missed by any member. Everyone should participate in team meetings. If you do not have any new ideas, for example, that is okay, but ask questions, especially if we are talking about a topic that you are unfamiliar with. At team meetings, participate if you have ideas. \u8232 \
	b.	Consequences for Failing to follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations: Reprimand by other team members if it is a problem. If you consistently fail to follow procedures and the group work is suffering, we will talk as a group about how to fix the issues, and talk to the professor too if necessary. \uc0\u8232 \
	c.	Expected level of communication with other team members: We should be very communicative. We can use the groupme to communicate things like when and where you are working, when we will finish certain tasks by, when you need someone else work, when we can meet, what problems are arising, etc. Everyone on the team should understand what everyone else is working on and be able to talk to everyone about anything related to the project. \uc0\u8232 \
	d.	Expected level of commitment to team decisions: We will discuss who is doing what tasks, so everyone should be complete their task since that was the group\'92s decision. Communicate to the group if there is a problem or you would like to change tasks after they have been assigned. We will try to be flexible. We will commit to decisions made as a team. If a decision has been made by the group and later a member realizes it should be different, consult with the group and we can either agree and change what needs to be changed, or continue with the original decision. \uc0\u8232 \
	4.	Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations \
	a.	Describe, as a group, you would handle infractions of any of the obligations of this team \uc0\u8232 contract: We will discuss as a group how we can change the problem and how to move \u8232 forward from the issue. \u8232 \
	b.	Describe what your team will do if the infractions continue: We will seek advice from the \uc0\u8232 professor if we cannot stop the infractions ourselves. \u8232 \
